The primary goal of this application is to handle essential student data and management tasks.

* **Student Details Storage:** A system to input and view basic student information.
* **Simple Management Interface:** Tools designed to help the department manage student records efficiently.
* **Frontend Focus:** The entire application is built using only client-side technologies.
