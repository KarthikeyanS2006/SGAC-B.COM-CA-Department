## 🌟 Project Overview

This is my **first attempt** at building a fully functional web application!

This project is a simple **Student Management System** developed specifically for the B.COM CA Department at SGAC. It was built entirely by me using fundamental web technologies to gain hands-on experience in frontend development.

## ✨ Key Features

The primary goal of this application is to handle essential student data and management tasks.

* **Student Details Storage:** A system to input and view basic student information.
* **Simple Management Interface:** Tools designed to help the department manage student records efficiently.
* **Frontend Focus:** The entire application is built using only client-side technologies.

## 💻 Technologies Used

| **HTML** | Structuring the web pages and content. |
| **CSS** | Styling the application for a clean, user-friendly interface. |
| **JavaScript (JS)** | Implementing the core logic, functionality, and data handling. |
