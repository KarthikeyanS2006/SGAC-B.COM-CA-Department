## 🎯 Project Goal and Purpose

This project is a **standalone Student Management System (SMS)** specifically created for the B.COM (Computer Applications) Department.

It represents my **first self-directed development effort** to build a functional web application from scratch. The core purpose of this system is to provide a simple, effective digital interface for managing and accessing essential student details and departmental information without relying on external frameworks or backend databases.

### Key Focus:

* **Self-Learning:** A practical exercise to master fundamental HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic.
* **Utility:** Providing basic, centralized data storage and management capabilities for student records.
* **Simplicity:** Maintaining a clean, client-side structure for ease of deployment and maintenance.

## ✨ Key Features

The primary goal of this application is to handle essential student data and management tasks.

* **Student Details Storage:** A system to input and view basic student information.
* **Simple Management Interface:** Tools designed to help the department manage student records efficiently.
* **Frontend Focus:** The entire application is built using only client-side technologies.
